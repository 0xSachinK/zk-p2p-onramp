# ZKP MOOC Hackathon submission

## Project Description

ZKP2P is a privacy preserving trustless P2P fiat onramp that can integrate with any web2 payment rails (e.g. Venmo) 
without permission from the payment network itself. We build upon the 0xParc / PSE ZK-Email libraries to prove the 
contents in a payment email and bring that data on-chain in a privacy preserving manner to unlock escrowed assets on-chain.

Our current PoC deployed at https://zkp2p.xyz enables trustless and privacy-preserving USDC to USD trades on the Goerli network using Venmo as the off-chain payment rails.
Our PoC is live and you can test it out. ðŸ˜„ 

We began to hack on this submission at ZKHack Lisbon in early April where we built a working v0. Since then we have re-worked the flow to add privacy as first class citizen. We modified our circuits and smart contracts to preserve privacy of Venmo ID of our users, enabled full client side proving so that no private data is leaked to a server, and added optimizations to make the client side proving faster.


### Flow
There are 2 actors in the system: 
1. On-rampers: Users who intend to trade their USD on Venmo to USDC on-chain.
2. Off-rampers: Users who intend to trade their USDC on-chain to USD on Venmo.

<!-- **Onramp / Offramp**
1. Onrampers create a new order specifying the amount of USDC they want to receive and the maximum amount of USD they are willing to pay

2. Offrampers view orders that are posted and can indicate interest in filling an onrampers order by claiming. When offrampers claim an order, they lock their USDC to the Ramp escrow contract. Multiple offrampers can indicate interest in an order.

3. Offrampers send a Venmo request off-chain to the onramper's Venmo ID. Multiple offrampers can send Venmo request to the onramper
4. Onramper chooses which Venmo request to complete the charge for and check that `orderID`, offramper `userID`, and amount are correct
5. Onramper completes request and downloads the confirmation email from Venmo. They generate a proof of the confirmation email and submit the transaction on-chain to unlock the escrow funds

## Technology Overview

### Circuits
#### ZK-email-verify
Our circuits are build on top of the [zk-email-verify](https://github.com/zkemail/zk-email-verify) circuits. We borrow the following circuits and scripts written by the zk-email team:
- **RSA Signature verification**: Verifies a signature signed by a 2048 bit RSA public key
- **SHA256 Partial hashing**: Completes the sha256 hash given a pre-computed state. Allows us to calculate first part of the partial hashes outside the circuit thus reducing proving time.
- **Regex circuit generator script**: To perform arbitrary regex checks within the circom framework, they implemented a Python script that converts a given regex into a deterministic finite automata (DFA) and then represents the DFA via gate operations in circom code.

#### Venmo Email regex circuits
We used their regex circuit generator scripts to generate our own regex circuits for parsing a venmo payment email. Currently we have the following regex circuits:
- **[Venmo Off-ramper ID Regex](./circuit/venmo_offramper_id_regex.circom)**: This regex circuit extracts out the venmo ID of the payee (user who was paid) from a venmo payment email's body. Written in circom.
- **[Venmo Amount Regex](./circuit/venmo_amount_regex.circom)**: This regex circuit extracts out the amount sent from a venmo payment email's header. Written in circom.

#### P2P OnRamp Circuit:
This is our main circuit written in circom and it performs the following operations:
* It accepts the email as an input and checks if the email header and body are signed by Venmo using RSA and SHA-256, ensuring the email's authenticity.
* It extracts the venmo ID of the payee (user who was paid) from the email's body and hashes it.
* It extracts the amount of USD transacted in the venmo email from the email's header and packs it into smaller chunks.
* Public signals revealed by the circuit:
    - RSA signature modulus against which the signature was checked. Is Venmo's DNS public key.
    - Hash of the payee's Venmo ID
    - Amount of USD paid to payee
    - Order ID specified by the on-ramper generating the proof [To prevent frontrunning]

Following table represents information about our circuit:
|Metric|Value|
|------|------|

### Proof generation in the browser

To preserver privacy of the user's email we opted for generating ZK proofs in the browser. Optimizations added to make client side proving faster:

#### Chunked Proving key
The size of our proving key is **3.5GB** which makes it difficult to download and generate proofs. So we chunked our keys into 10 parts using [sampriti's snarkjs fork](https://github.com/sampritipanda/snarkjs#fef81fc51d17a734637555c6edbd585ecda02d9e). We then compressed each one of them and hosted them on a public [AWS S3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/zk-p2p-onramp?region=us-east-1&tab=objects). Sizes of the chunked proving keys in total is **1.95 GB**. A reduction in size of 45%.

#### Storing proving keys
The chunked proving keys are downloaded when the user generates the proof for the very first time. These chunked keys are stored in their compressed form in the local storage of the browser on the user's machine, so that 
the user doesn't has to downaload the proving key again and waste network bandwidth.

Table presents steps taken to generate proof on the client end along with time taken for each step:
|Step|Time|
|------|------|
Chunked keys download (only once)| 207s (3.4s)
Proof generaiton | 623s (10.3 mins)

### Dev Server
We set up an AWS EC2 `z1d.12x large` instance as our development server. We chose this instance because it has one of the fastest single core performance for our circuit compilation and witness generation needs. It has 48 cores which speeds up our proving key generation. We followed the [best practices for large circuits](https://hackmd.io/V-7Aal05Tiy-ozmzTGBYPA?view) guide to setup our server. 

Table presents the various steps of circuit development alng with time taken to perform each step:
|Step|Time|
|------|------|
Compilation | 563.87s (9.3 mins)
Proving key generation| 782s (13 mins)
Chunked proving key generation| 3 hours
Witness geeration|60s
Proof generation using rapidsnark| 9.2s

### Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are written in Solidity and deployed on the Goerli test network. The contract provides trustless on-ramping and off-ramping mechanisms for USDC tokens using Venmo as the payment platform. The following functionalities are provided by the contract:

- **User Registration**: Users can register their Venmo IDs using the `register` function, which maps their Ethereum address to their Venmo ID and vice versa.

- **Posting Orders**: Registered users can post an order using the `postOrder` function, specifying the amount they want to receive and the maximum amount they're willing to pay. Orders are stored in the `orders` mapping, with an incremental `orderNonce` as the key.

- **Claiming Orders**: Users can claim an open order using the `claimOrder` function. The function verifies that the order is open and not claimed by the caller. The claimer submits their USDC tokens, and the order's claim status is updated accordingly.

- **On-Ramping**: Users can initiate the on-ramp process using the `onRamp` function, which verifies the zero-knowledge proof provided by the on-ramper. It checks if the order is open and if the off-ramper has submitted a claim. Once verified, the claim status is updated, the order is marked as filled, and USDC tokens are transferred to the on-ramper.

- **Canceling Orders**: Order creators can cancel their open orders using the `cancelOrder` function, which checks if the order is open and if the caller is the order creator before marking the order as canceled.

- **Clawback**: Users can claw back their funds from submitted claims that haven't been used or have expired using the `clawback` function. The function checks the claim status and order status before transferring the USDC tokens back to the caller.

- **View Functions**: The contract offers view functions for retrieving claims associated with a specific order (`getClaimsForOrder`) and fetching all orders (`getAllOrders`).

- The contract uses the `IERC20` interface from OpenZeppelin for handling ERC20 token (USDC) interactions and a custom `Verifier` contract for handling zero-knowledge proofs. The contract stores orders and claims in mappings and maintains various enums and structs to represent order and claim statuses. 

The contract addresses on the Goerli network are: 
- Ramp - [0x805a3Ae6495Be653dE460685D5FFDD5A538550f1](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x805a3Ae6495Be653dE460685D5FFDD5A538550f1)
- FakeUSDC - [0xb685Bdc019DEE17D073746a88bF6a6cDDED8Ae70](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xb685Bdc019DEE17D073746a88bF6a6cDDED8Ae70)


## Approach to Problem

Our team aimed to create an end-to-end application that showcases the power of zero-knowledge proofs in fostering trustless interactions with existing Web 2.0 services. Drawing inspiration from the zk-email protocol, which enables users to prove their Twitter handle ownership through the verification of a DKIM-signed confirmation email, we recognized the potential for enhancing user experiences in onboarding and offboarding processes.

Onboarding, in particular, presents a problem for users seeking trustless end-to-end solutions. Currently, these solutions may require up to five minutes for client-side proof generation, yet they remain more competitive than the existing alternatives. New retail users face substantial barriers when attempting to onboard funds into the Web3 ecosystem. They must either register with a centralized exchange like Coinbase with prohibitive KYC requirements and long confirmation windows, or use centralized fiat onramps with high fees.

Additionally, crypto natives struggle to offboard funds for use in the real world, as only institutional accounts have direct access to convert USDC or USDT to USD. Existing P2P solutions, such as LocalBitcoins and OTC desks, either necessitate in-person meetings or rely on trusted intermediaries.

To address these issues, we designed a user-friendly onboarding flow that mitigates the need for synchronous coordination between counterparties. On-rampers can post their orders on-chain, including their Venmo IDs (an aspect we are working to improve), allowing multiple off-rampers to submit competitive bids through the payment service. The off-ramper then confirms the best order, generates a proof from the email confirmation, and submits that on chain to unlock the USDC.

In our first iteration, we made assumptions about user preferences, such as their willingness to register their Venmo ID with their address, similar to revealing their Twitter handle. As we move toward production, we will continue to refine our application, addressing these assumptions and enhancing the overall user experience.
